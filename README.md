## Introduction

Nightcode is a simple IDE for Clojure. It integrates a copy of Leiningen as well as the lein-cljsbuild and lein-droid plugins. The goal is to provide a simple, all-in-one solution to get started with Clojure programming for the command line, the desktop, the web, and Android. Please see [the website](https://sekao.net/nightcode/) for more details.
